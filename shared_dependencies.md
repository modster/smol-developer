1. HTML and CSS: Both "index.html" and "css/style.css" files share the HTML and CSS language dependency. HTML is used for the structure of the website, while CSS is used for the styling.

2. Tailwind CSS: Both "index.html" and "css/tailwind.css" share the Tailwind CSS framework dependency. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is used for styling the website.

3. DOM Elements: The "index.html" file will contain all the DOM elements. The id names of these elements will be shared with any JavaScript functions that interact with them. As per the user's prompt, there is no mention of JavaScript, so we can't specify any id names or function names.

4. CSS Classes: The CSS classes defined in "css/style.css" and "css/tailwind.css" will be shared with the "index.html" file. These classes will be used to apply styles to the HTML elements.

5. Linking of CSS files: The "index.html" file will have links to the "css/style.css" and "css/tailwind.css" files. This is a shared dependency as the HTML file needs to know the location of the CSS files to apply the styles.

6. Media Queries: If the website is responsive, then the media queries defined in the CSS files will be shared across the HTML file to ensure the website is displayed correctly on different screen sizes.

Please note that without specific details about the website's content and functionality, it's not possible to provide a detailed list of shared dependencies such as exported variables, data schemas, id names of every DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use, message names, and function names.
